## ðŸ”§ Install Script Fixes

### Fix install script to build server from source for NanoGPT support

- **Local server building**: Changed install script to build Plandex server from source instead of using pre-built Docker images
- **NanoGPT support**: Ensures new users automatically get the latest server with NanoGPT universal provider support
- **Docker configuration**: Updated docker-compose.yml to build from source for better compatibility
- **Credential checking**: Fixed credential validation to properly recognize NanoGPT for all model publishers

This fix ensures that users installing Plandex in local mode get the most up-to-date server with all the latest provider integrations and bug fixes, rather than potentially outdated Docker Hub images.

**Technical details**: Modified the install script's Docker setup to build the server locally, ensuring users always get the current codebase rather than relying on external image repositories that may lag behind the latest releases.
