### Fix for panic in execTellPlan when active plan is nil

- **Fixed critical panic error**: Resolved "Invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" panic that occurred during plan execution
- **Race condition fix**: Added nil check in panic recovery defer block to prevent crashes when active plan is cleaned up during execution
- **Improved stability**: Enhanced error handling in the tell execution flow to prevent server crashes

This fix addresses a race condition where the active plan could be cleaned up between creation and execution, causing the panic recovery code to attempt accessing a nil pointer. The server is now more resilient to timing issues during plan execution.

**Technical details**: Added proper nil checking in `execTellPlan` function's panic recovery mechanism to ensure the server doesn't crash when trying to send error messages to a non-existent active plan channel.
